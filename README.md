Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================

The script run_analysis.r produces the final tidy dataset requested in step 5 of the course project. Along the way, the script carries out the work for steps 1-4. 

In order for the script to work, the following datasets from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip need to placed in the working directory:

activity_labels.txt
features.txt

subject_test.txt
X_train.txt
y_train.txt
X_test.txt
y_test.txt
